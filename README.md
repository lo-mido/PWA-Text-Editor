  ## Description
  **Paragraph 1: Assignment Description**

The assignment requires building a Progressive Web Application (PWA) text editor that operates both online and offline. The application utilizes IndexedDB for data storage and implements the idb package to achieve data persistence. The goal is to create a reliable tool for users to create and retrieve notes or code snippets, regardless of their internet connection.

**Paragraph 2: Motivation**

My motivation behind this project is to showcase my expertise in web development, data persistence, and PWA implementation. By completing this assignment, I demonstrate my ability to create a seamless user experience, even in offline environments. Additionally, this project enhances my portfolio, making me a more attractive candidate for potential employers.

**Paragraph 3: Problem Solving**

To solve the problem, I utilized the idb package, which serves as a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API. This allowed me to implement methods for storing and retrieving data efficiently. I also followed the provided guidelines and best practices to ensure the application meets the PWA criteria and functions without errors both online and offline.


  ## Usage

**Paragraph 4: Lessons Learned and Purpose**

Throughout this project, I learned valuable skills in implementing data persistence, creating PWAs, and ensuring a seamless user experience. The purpose of this application is to provide users with a reliable text editor for note-taking and code snippets, accessible even without an internet connection. It serves as a demonstration of my abilities in building robust web applications.

- **Command-Line Applications:** I gained experience in building command-line applications using Node.js. Handling user input and generating output in a terminal environment was a fundamental skill I developed during this project.

- **File Manipulation:** The project involved dynamically creating and updating files. I learned how to programmatically generate README content and structure it appropriately.

- **Inquirer Package:** idb: Lightweight wrapper around IndexedDB API, used for data storage.
Webpack: Module bundler for JavaScript applications.
JavaScript: Language used for implementing client-side functionality.
